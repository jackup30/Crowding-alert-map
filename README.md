Our project is based on creating an application that informs people about those areas with high vulnerability of contagion, this through the GPS of mobile devices creating a map that indicates the most crowded places, The implementation will allow individuals to register to provide information necessary to assess their current state of health and the application will provide alerts to persons with a high probability of being affected.
